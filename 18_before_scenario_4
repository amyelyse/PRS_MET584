## The SNPs don't need to be processed through scenarios 2 and 3 because no SNPs end up being flipped.
## Therefore, move onto the code needed to run before scenario 4
## Also note that the MHC has already been removed from this set of SNPs

## Scenario 4 - identify SNPs where A1/A2 STILL don't match between local and external data 

## Use .bim file from output of scenario 1 to create new CLOZUK/SAVAGE SNP and A1 file
