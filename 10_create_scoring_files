## Generating files required for polygenic profile scoring
##### Create your .raw .dat and .qrange files for scoring #####

# File was copied to my directory as it involves accessing the PGC GWAS summary stats (permissions)

# Create the .dat file containing the SNPID and the P-value
# Pulling the SNPID and P-value out of the prs_ready files for different file subsets, across chromosomes using a for loop.
# The words that make the prs_ready files unique in the array are 'full', 'blood', and 'brain'

# Create .qrange file for p-value thresholds for PRS
# Two thresholds tested: S1 = 0.00 - 0.05; S2 = 0.00 - 1.00

# The same .raw and .qrange files were the same for all three sets of scores; differences only lie in the .dat and input files
